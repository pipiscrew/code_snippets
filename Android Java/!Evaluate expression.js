“Display View” is another efficient helper in evaluating expressions. 
Activate it from Window > Show View > Display, write your expressions to evaluate
and execute them by right clicking and selecting “Display” from the context menu in the Debug
perspective or simply by Ctrl+Shift+D shortcut. You can use code assist (Ctrl+Space) to 
compose your expressions.

Select the expression you like and press CTRL+SHIFT+D
ofc there is no reason for println work there.

ex.
System.out.println(bombDate);
	(No explicit return value)



iVersion != "23"
	 (boolean) true
	 
	 iVersion
	 (java.lang.String) v5.00
