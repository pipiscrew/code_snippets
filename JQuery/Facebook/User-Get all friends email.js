The problem happens when you are trying to export contacts that have been imported from Facebook or another system.  
You can either open each contact, make a small change and save it, or you can choose to print them.  
This will give you a pdf that can be copied and pasted into a spreadsheet.  It takes a little while to reformat it, 
but ultimately a lot faster than opening each contact and resaving it.

Choose Print > Basic View > XPS then use stduviewer to export xps data to text!
