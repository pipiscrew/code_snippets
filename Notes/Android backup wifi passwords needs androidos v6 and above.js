If your device runs Android 6.0 and up, you can back up and restore the following items on your Android device:

Apps
Call History
Device Settings
Contacts
Calendar
SMS (Pixel phones only)
Photos & videos (Pixel phones only)
To turn on Backup, please follow the steps below:
Open your device’s Settings app.
Tap System and then Backup.
Turn on Back up to Google Drive.
When you add your Google Account to a device that’s been set up, what you’d previously backed up for that Google Account gets put onto the device. To restore a backed-up account to a reset device, follow the on-screen steps. You can’t restore a backup from a higher Android version onto a phone running a lower Android version. Learn how to check and update your Android version.

When you reinstall an app, you can restore app settings that you’d previously backed up with your Google Account.

To restore app settings:

Open your device’s Settings app.
Tap System and then Backup and then App data.
Turn on Automatic restore.
Note: Not all apps can back up or restore all settings and data.
