Use	Returns true if
op1 > op2	op1 is greater than op2
op1 >= op2 	op1 is greater than or equal to op2
op1 < op2 	op1 is less than to op2
op1 <= op2 	op1 is less than or equal to op2
op1 == op2 	op1 and op2 are equal
op1 != op2 	op1 and op2 are not equal

//greater than
	System.out.println("Greater than...");
