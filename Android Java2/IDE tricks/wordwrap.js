//you have to set all!
Comment width and line wrapping is set in Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter, then click on the Edit button and select the Comments tab. I like Line Width for Comments to be 120.

Code line wrapping is set nearby, in Preferences->Java->Code Style- >Formatter, then click on the Edit button and select the Line Wrapping tab. I like a line width of 120 and indent size of 4.

Indentation is set separately, in Preferences->Java->Code Style- >Formatter, then click on the Edit button and select the Indentation tab. I like an indent size of 4, consistent with the Line Wrapping indent setting.

As if that's not enough, you can also set printer margins, tab size, etc, in Preferences>General>Editors>Text Editors where I set the Displayed Tab Width to 4 and Print Margin Column to 120 or more.
